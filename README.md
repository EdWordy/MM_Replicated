# Motion Matching Replicated
A replicated motion matching plugin for Unreal Engine 5 (based on the gameplay anim sample).

Forked from https://github.com/cenairaclub/motionmatchingreplicated

### FEATURES

-Replicated animations and motion matching

-Rudimentary Dynamic Weapon Overlays (ie basic weapon system -- press 1 or 2)

-Doesn't use smoothsync

-Plugin based for ease of use

### KNOWN ISSUES

-Autonomous proxies seem to jitter when they are look rotating (ie when player 1 is look rotating, on player 2s screen the proxy for P1 will slightly jitter)
